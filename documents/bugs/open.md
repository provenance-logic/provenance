# Open Issues

Known bugs and unresolved issues on the Provenance platform. Sorted by severity (high → low). Resolved items move to [resolved.md](./resolved.md) with the commit that fixed them.

**Triage conventions**

- **Severity** — Blocker (breaks a P0 flow for real users), High (breaks a P0 flow only in non-prod, or a P1 flow in prod), Medium (UX friction, workaround exists), Low (cosmetic / doc / dev ergonomics).
- **Status** — Open, In progress, Needs repro. Every fix PR must close the entry with the commit hash and move it to `resolved.md`.

## B-001 — Mailhog dev email not surfaced in UI

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** Open
- **Area:** Onboarding / developer experience
- **Environment:** EC2 dev (`https://dev.provenancelogic.com`)

**Symptom.** New users who trigger any flow that sends email (self-serve signup welcome email, invitation accept link, UPDATE_PASSWORD link) cannot see the email from the UI — they must have shell access on the EC2 host and `curl http://localhost:8025` to read Mailhog's inbox. Non-engineering stakeholders evaluating the platform cannot complete onboarding.

**Root cause.** `infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.ec2-dev.yml` runs Mailhog with port `8025` bound only to the host loopback; Caddy does not expose it on `dev.provenancelogic.com`. There is no in-app "dev inbox" viewer.

**Proposed fix.** Two options:
1. Add a Caddy route `/mailhog/*` (behind basic auth or a dev-only IP allowlist) that proxies to `mailhog:8025`. Lowest-effort.
2. Embed a minimal React inbox viewer in the frontend that queries Mailhog's `/api/v2/messages` endpoint. Better UX but more code.

Option 1 is acceptable for dev. Not an issue for production (real SES there).

## B-002 — Two-view inconsistency: dashboard vs marketplace product views

- **Severity:** Medium
- **Status:** Open
- **Area:** Discovery / publishing

**Symptom.** The same data product renders different information depending on which surface the user lands on:
- `apps/web/src/features/publishing/ProductDetail.tsx` (reached from `/dashboard/:orgId/domains/:domainId/products/:productId`) shows one set of fields.
- `apps/web/src/features/discovery/ProductDetailPage.tsx` (reached from `/marketplace/:orgId/:productId`) shows a different set.

Domain owners see one shape of truth while consumers see another, leading to confusion about what a product actually exposes (ownership, freshness, column schema, access status).

**Root cause.** The two pages grew independently — the publishing view was written first for domain teams; the marketplace view was written later and adopted a different get-product shape. Neither was consolidated when the 5.4 P1 enrichment work landed.

**Proposed fix.** Both pages should consume the same product-detail hook backed by a single `get_product` response shape. The PRD v1.4 "Domain 9 Priority 1 completeness" gap is adjacent — resolve together.

## B-003 — WCAG 2.1 AA compliance unverified

- **Severity:** Medium (Blocker for public open-source launch per the accessibility commitment)
- **Status:** Open

**Symptom.** The frontend has not been audited against WCAG 2.1 AA. Known gaps spotted casually: no skip-links, inconsistent focus outlines after Tailwind reset, some icon-only buttons without `aria-label`, form validation error text associated by proximity rather than `aria-describedby`.

**Proposed fix.** Run `axe-core` against every top-level route, fix hard failures, and add a lint-time a11y check (`eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` is already pulled in; raise its rules from warn to error). Add a `documents/architecture/accessibility.md` that names the target, the audit tooling, and the sign-off criteria before a release can ship.

## B-004 — .gitignore pattern silently ignores future realm JSONs

- **Severity:** Low
- **Status:** Open

**Symptom.** `.gitignore` contains `infrastructure/docker/config/keycloak/realms/*.json`, yet `provenance-realm.json` is tracked — it was added to the index before the ignore rule. A developer who adds a second realm file (e.g. a staging or demo realm) to the same directory will see it silently ignored with no warning. `git add` will succeed without tracking the file unless they force-add.

**Root cause.** The ignore pattern was intended to block environment-specific overrides (like `realms/local.json`) but is too broad — it also matches the canonical committed realm. The current state relies on the accident that the canonical file was added first.

**Proposed fix.** Flip the pattern to an exclusion list. Either:
- Replace `*.json` + `!.gitkeep` with an explicit allowlist: `*.json` + `!provenance-realm.json` + `!.gitkeep`.
- Or rename the ignored pattern to a narrower convention, e.g. `realms/*.local.json`, and ignore only that.

Verify by trying `touch infrastructure/docker/config/keycloak/realms/demo.json && git status` — it must show the file as untracked (visible), not as ignored.
